## Week 0: Data Preprocessing

Hello World, 

Welcome to #MachineLearningMondays 
* Case Study: Data Preprocessing
* DataSet:

When it comes to creating a Machine Learning model, data preprocessing is the first step marking the initiation of the process. Typically, real-world data is incomplete, inconsistent, inaccurate (contains errors or outliers), and often lacks specific attribute values/trends. This is where data preprocessing enters the scenario â€“ it helps to clean, format, and organise the raw data, thereby making it ready-to-go for Machine Learning models.
